# EDA-with-ggplot

This repository contains all the exercises I worked on while taking Udacity's Exploratory Data Analysis course. 
The course was focused on exploring interesting trends in data using ggplot. I have uploaded html files creating using R Markdown.
The html page is visible in its original format using this link

Just paste the link of the repo on this page and the html would be viewable.
